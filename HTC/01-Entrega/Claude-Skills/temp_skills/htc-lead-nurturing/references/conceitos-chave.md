Subject: Should I close your file?

[Name],

I haven't heard from you in a while.

Are you still interested in [goal]?

If YES: Reply "YES" and I'll keep sending value
If NO: Reply "REMOVE" and I'll take you off

Your call.
```

**Results:**
- 10-20% re-engage
- 5-10% unsubscribe (good list hygiene)
