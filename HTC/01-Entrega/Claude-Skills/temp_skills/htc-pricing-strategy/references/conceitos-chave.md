# Conceitos-Chave: Estratégia de Preços para High Ticket

## 1. Filosofia: Value-Based Pricing

Price baseado em value delivered, não hours worked.

**Equação:**
```
Price = (Transformation Value × Perceived Value × Scarcity)
         ---------------------------------------------------
                  (Risk + Effort + Alternatives)
```
