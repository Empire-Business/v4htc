# Conceitos-Chave: Sales Scripts para High Ticket

## 1. Filosofia de Vendas Consultivas

High Ticket não é sobre "fechar" - é sobre **descobrir** e **resolver problemas**.

**Key Principles:**
1. Diagnose antes de prescrever
2. Ouça mais que fala (80/20 rule)
3. Foque em transformação, não transação
4. Venda o resultado, não as features
5. Peça commitment authentically
6. Objeções são perguntas, não rejeições

**Script Template:**
```
"Thanks for making time today, [Name].

Before we dive in, I want to make sure I respect your time.
We've got [X] minutes together - does that still work?

Great. Here's what I'd propose:
1. First, I learn about your situation
2. Then I share what might help
3. We decide if there's a fit

Sound good?

Also, just so you know - I work with people I genuinely
believe I can help. If at the end it doesn't feel like
the right fit, I'll tell you. Fair?"
```

### Stage 2: Discovery (Próximos 15 min)

**Goals:**
- Uncover real problem (não surface)

"What does your typical [day/week] look like..."
```

**P - Problem Questions:**
```
"What's the biggest challenge with..."
"What frustrates you most about..."

"Who else is impacted by this..."
```

```

"What would [result] mean for your [life/business]..."
"If you could [transformation], what would that give you..."
"What's your vision for [area] in [timeframe]..."
```

### Stage 3: The Pivot (Bridge to Solution)

**Goal:** Transition naturally from problem to solution

**Script:**
```
"Thanks for sharing all that.

Let me make sure I've got this right:

[Paraphrase back their situation + pain + desire]

And the cost of staying here is [reiterate implication].

Is that accurate?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"Great. Here's what I know:

[Name], I've helped [number] of [people like them] with
exactly this challenge. And I have good news:

This is solvable. You're in the right place.

Here's how we'd approach this..."
```

### Stage 4: Presentation (A Solução)

**Goals:**
- Present solution como óbvia resposta
- Show como addresses tudo que compartilharam
- Build belief e desire
- Make feel exclusivo para eles

**Customized Presentation Script:**
```
"Based on everything you've shared, here's what I'd recommend:

[Program Name] - [Duration]

This is going to help you [their specific outcome] through:

[Component 1]: This addresses [their challenge] by [how]
[Component 2]: This means [benefit]
[Component 3]: This gives you [result]

Here's what this would look like for you specifically:

[Customize 2-3 points to their situation]

The investment for this is R$[price].

Now, I know that might feel like a lot. But let me ask:

If this helps you [specific outcome],
what would that be worth to you?"
```

### Stage 5: Closing (O Commitment)

**Direct Close Script:**
```
"So, [Name], based on everything we've discussed:
- Your [challenge]
- Your [goal]
- Your [timeline]

Does this feel like the right fit?

[If yes]
"Great! Here's what happens next:
[Next steps]

Does that work for you?"

[If maybe]
"Fair question. What would help you feel confident?"

[If no]
"Totally fine. Can I ask what doesn't feel right?"
```

## 3. Objection Handling Framework

### 3-Step Process

**Step 1: Acknowledge & Validate**
```
"I hear you."
"That's a fair question."
"I understand that concern."
```

**Step 2: Isolate & Clarify**
```
"Is [X] the only thing holding you back?"
"So aside from [X], you're feeling good?"
"Just so I understand - [restate objection]?"
```

**Step 3: Respond & Check**
```
[Response]

"Does that make sense?"
"How does that help?"
"Does that address your concern?"
```

### Common Objections & Scripts

**"I need to think about it"**
```
"Totally understand. This is an important decision.

Quick question: What specifically would you like to think about?
The program? The timing? The investment?

The people who get the best results are those who make
a clear decision and commit fully.

Does waiting feel like it'll get you closer to your goal?"
```

**"It's too expensive"**
```
"I hear that. Let me ask:

What's the cost of NOT solving this?

If you stay where you are for another 6-12 months,
what will that cost you?

[Wait]

So when you look at it that way, does the investment
feel more like an expense or an investment in your future?"
```

## 4. Closing Techniques

### The Assumptive Close
```
"Great! So we'll get you started on [date].

Does [payment option] work better for you?"
```

### The Alternative Close
```
"Would you prefer to start this week or next month?

Would the [payment plan] or [pay in full] work better?"
```

### The Summary Close
```
"So just to recap:
You're getting [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3].

For an investment of [price]. And we'll start on [date].

Ready to move forward?"
