## CALL SCRIPT (30-60 min)

### 0-5 min: Rapport & Context

**You:** "Thanks for making time today, [Name]. I've been looking forward to our conversation."

**You:** "Before we dive in, I want to make sure I respect your time. We've got 45-60 minutes together - does that still work for you?"

2. Then I'll share what might help based on my experience working with [number] of [similar clients]

3. Finally, we can decide if there's a fit to work together

Sound fair?"

**[Get agreement]**

**You:** "Great! Also, just so you know - I only work with people I genuinely believe I can help. If at the end it doesn't feel like the right fit, I'll tell you. I don't want to waste your time or mine. Fair?"
